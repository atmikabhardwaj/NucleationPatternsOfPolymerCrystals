# About

The data set was generated from molecular dynamics simulation of coarse-grained poly(vinyl alcohol) (CGPVA) in LAMMPS. The details of the analysis are detailed in the paper
Atmika Bhardwaj, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Marco Werner 
"Nucleation patterns of polymer crystals analyzed by machine learning models".
